        <h3>Would you like to learn some html basics?</h3>
       <pre> <span>well this is all written in a &lt;span&gt; html tag which is inline so anything i write will stay on this line and it may even go off screen as it is a piece of text or content that only takes up what is nessesary to display info</span> </pre>
       <pre><p>now i am typing or talking to you in a &lt;p&gt; tag which is a block element so it will create a new line for content to be displayed on and you can see that as there is some space between this tag and the &lt;span&gt; tag</p></pre>
